# udp-blast node.js stream module

Writable stream that packetizes the input and streams it to the network using the UDP protocol.

## Usage

```javascript
var Fs = require('fs');
var UdpBlast = require('udp-blast');

var dst = { host: 'localhost', port: 1234 };
var options = { packetSize: 1024 };

var blaster = new UdpBlast(dst, options);

// blast as fast as possible
Fs.createReadStream(â€¦).pipe(blaster);
```

## Methods

### new UdpBlast(dst, [options])

This creates a new `Writable` stream that quickly blasts any input.

`dst` should be an `object` with `host` and `port` properties.
If `dst` is a number, it will be treated as: `{ host: 'localhost', port: dst }`.

#### Options

* `packetSize` - Output `packetSize` bytes in each UDP packet, default = 512.
* `ttl` - Set TTL for the UDP packets.
* `highWaterMark` - `Writable` buffering option.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install udp-blast
```
